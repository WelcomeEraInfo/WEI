- Time : 时隔天数计算 | Calculation of interval days
    - 输入第一个年月日和第二个年月日，自动计算两个年月日的时隔天数。主要使用判断指令和循环指令。对输入有效值的处理，根据前一个输入确定下一个输入的范围。对日的处理，依据年月大小对比前后输入日的大小进行总体自增或自减天数间隔差值。对月的处理，依据年的大小对输入的月上限天数进行自增或自减占比天数间隔差值。对年的处理，依据输入的年大小进行年上限天数的自增或自减占比天数间隔差值。使用跨年出现平年闰年差异的天数补偿，跨年时输入前后年同为闰年或平年时无差异，前为闰年后为平年使用自增补偿，前为平年后为闰年使用自减补偿。天数计量处理，使用大值自减与另值相同时所减值代表差值。变量赋值处理，一类变量用来保存输入时的变量，另一类变量用来变值计算。使用的主要计算模块，日的增减模块，月的同效日数增减模块，年的同效日数增减模块，跨年的平年闰年日数补偿模块。使用的主要条件判断，月份的上限天数选择判断，平年闰年的上限天数选择判断。 | Enter the first and second dates of year, month and day, and the number of days between the two dates will be automatically calculated. The main instructions used are judgment instructions and loop instructions. The processing of valid input values determines the range of the next input based on the previous one. The processing of days is based on the comparison of the size of the input days before and after the year and month, and the overall increase or decrease of the number of days interval difference is made. For the processing of months, based on the size of the year, the upper limit of the number of days in the input month is automatically increased or decreased by adjusting the interval difference of the number of days. The processing of the year is based on the size of the input year, and the difference in the proportion of the number of days in the upper limit of the year is automatically increased or decreased. Use the compensation for the number of days when there is a difference between a common year and a leap year across years. If there is no difference when both the previous and subsequent years are leap years or common years, use the auto-increment compensation and the auto-decrement compensation when the previous year is a common year and the subsequent year is a leap year. The processing is measured by the number of days. When the maximum value is reduced and the other value is the same, the reduced value represents the difference. Variable assignment processing: One type of variable is used to store the input variable, and the other type is used for variable value calculation. The main calculation modules used include the daily increase and decrease module, the monthly increase and decrease module for the number of days with the same effect, the annual increase and decrease module for the number of days with the same effect, and the compensation module for the number of days in common and leap years across years. The main conditions used for judgment, the selection judgment of the upper limit of days for each month, and the selection judgment of the upper limit of days for common years and leap years.
